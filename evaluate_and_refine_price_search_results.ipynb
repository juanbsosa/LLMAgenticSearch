They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?

Can a rototiller be used in rocky soil?\\nA. Running a rototiller over rock can damage the tines. It is best to remove rocks by hand.\\nQ. Can a rototiller remove tree roots from the soil?\\nA. Rototillers will not break up large roots.\\nQ. How deep do rototillers dig?\\nA. A rear-tine, gas-powered rototiller can dig 8 to 10 inches deep.

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?

Learn More ›\\nWhen it comes to gardening, a rototiller can save an incredible amount of time and effort. Good soil preparation is a key component to successful gardening, but manually turning the soil can be a slow, arduous process. That’s where rototillers come in handy. We tested seven rototillers of different sizes and prices, tilling more than 4,000 square feet of soil in the process. To find the best rototillers on the market, we used each tiller in a variety of ways, such as tilling existing garden beds, cultivating weedy garden paths, aerating compost piles, and breaking ground to create new garden spaces.\\xa0\\nA good rototiller or cultivator for any garden must be able to comfortably maneuver through the space while loosening and aerating compacted soil, removing weeds, and incorporating soil amendments. For some users’ needs, this may call for a small battery-powered cultivator, while others may require a large gas rototiller. Our favorite of the group, the Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller, turned a high volume of soil faster than any of the others. It was easy to operate for extended use, and it caused negligible physical strain and operator fatigue.\\xa0\\nThis guide includes large, medium, and small tillers and cultivators powered by gas and electricity. Each has been garden tested and evaluated for digging power, maneuverability, and user comfort. Whether your garden calls for a heavy-duty rear tine tiller, a powerful front tine model, or a compact garden cultivator, this roundup of the best rototillers could help you find the right one for your garden space.\\xa0\\nHow We Tested the Best Rototillers\\nRototillers are mostly used to turn brand-new ground that is currently covered with established vegetation, or for seasonal tilling and cultivation in an existing garden. We marked out two testing plots: 2,500 square feet in an existing garden and 1,500 square feet in an established lawn. After assembling the tillers, we used each one to turn up sections of both test plots—first at a shallow depth, then at the maximum depth.\\nAfter the test runs, we noted our observations on a scoring rubric. To be included in this guide, a tiller had to be comfortable to operate and powerful enough to penetrate hardpan soil. In addition to noting specifications like power ratings and dimensions, we assessed ease of use, performance, durability, and perceived value. Finally, we assigned superlative awards for each model that passed our criteria.\\xa0\\nOur Top Picks\\nA rototiller quickly turns hard-packed soil into a crumbly and plant-friendly haven. Whether you’re breaking new ground for an expansive veggie garden or refreshing a small flower bed for seasonal color, one of our tested tillers could be just the tool for the job. In the reviews ahead, find out how each model performed in testing.\\xa0\\nBest Overall\\nTroy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.5/5; Performance 5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\nOur top choice for the best rototiller came down to power. The Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT garden rototiller features a 208cc gas engine and counter-rotating rear tines that easily churn through compacted soil without bouncing around as it climbs over roots and rocks. In our tests, it performed the best in terms of breaking new ground. It made the toughest seasonal tilling projects incredibly easy.\\nThis tiller started up easily—normally on the first pull of the cord—and was easy to control with one hand. The tines had no problem grinding up our hard clay-based soil and returning it to the tilling path in a nice, crumbly texture. When it encountered larger rocks (up to the size of a baseball), the machine ejected them smoothly without jumping or surging.\\nThis is not the largest rear tine tiller on the market, as it has a maximum tilling width of 16 inches and tills 6 inches deep. But the relatively modest size was ideal for our rectangular 1,500-square-foot test garden. That being said, it is designed to work in long, straight lines. Navigating turns in small and oddly shaped beds became cumbersome.\\nGet the Troy-Bilt rototiller at Tractor Supply Co. or The Home Depot.\\nBest Bang for the Buck\\nToro 10\" 2-Cycle 43cc Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\nFor smaller garden beds that you don’t want to turn by hand, a compact and maneuverable tiller is necessary. This cultivator from Toro makes soil preparation and plant cultivation easier with the help of its lightweight, streamlined design. As a bonus, it has the lowest price of all the rototillers we tested.\\nThe cultivator features onboard wheels with a locking spring mechanism that lets the operator raise and lower them for improved depth control. The tiller can be used with all four tines in place or just the inner two, resulting in a 10-inch or 6-inch tilling width, respectively. The overhand design on the handles gives the operator greater control and reduces bucking over rocks and debris in the soil.\\nWe were pleasantly surprised to find that this garden cultivator actually operated much like a bigger rototiller, albeit with modified bolo-style tines and a slower rotation speed. It produced an impressive amount of torque for the size, which allowed it to break up compacted garden soil and root out weeds fairly easily. But unsurprisingly, it was underpowered and underweight for breaking new ground. The upright handle design definitely helped to reduce bucking, but it also transferred that energy to our hands, arms, and shoulders, so it’s best for working existing garden beds—or for busting up the clumps after breaking new ground with a spade.\\xa0\\nGet the Toro rototiller at Amazon, Lowe’s, Tractor Supply Co., or Ace Hardware.\\nBest Battery-Powered\\nGreenworks 10\" 40V Cordless Cultivator With Battery\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.8/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\xa0\\nThe Greenworks cordless electric cultivator has a 4-amp motor and comes with a battery charger and a 40-volt 4 amp hour (Ah) battery that can power the tiller for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. Instead of having to deal with the pull-cord start typical of gas-powered tillers, this battery rototiller has an easy-to-operate push-button start.\\nThe rototiller weighs about 21 pounds and is supported by a pair of 6-inch wheels for easy transport. The four front tines till to a maximum depth of 5 inches, and the tilling width is adjustable between 8.25 inches and 10 inches.\\xa0\\nWith modified pick tines capable of striking 2,000 times per minute, this cultivator moved quickly through our compacted garden soil. The smaller tilling area and shallow depth allowed us to safely cultivate near garden plants. It did a nice job of weeding as well as blending compost and fertilizer into the soil surface without damaging plant roots. However, like the other small tillers we tested, this one is not equipped to break ground in a brand-new garden bed.\\xa0\\nGet the Greenworks rototiller at Amazon, Northern Tool + Equipment, or Greenworks.\\nBest Cultivator\\nHonda 9\" Mini-Tiller/Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.8/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\nWhen it comes to outdoor power equipment, Honda consistently excels. The Honda FG110 mini tiller/cultivator is no exception. Powered by a clean-running commercial-grade GX25 engine, this model delivers surprisingly aggressive groundbreaking capabilities despite its small size. It packs the power to help with tough weeding chores, or to incorporate fertilizer and other soil amendments into the garden.\\nThis tiller features plow-style handlebars with an on/off switch conveniently located next to the hand grips. It comes with modified bolo-style 6-point tines that can be configured in either 6-inch or 9-inch widths. Moving at 294 RPM, they easily chew up weeds and compacted soil, as well as break ground for new garden beds.\\nWhile this was the most expensive of the three smallest gas rototillers we tested, it was also arguably the most capable. The 25cc engine produced higher RPM, and the tines chopped more aggressively through tough soil and weeds, making it the most efficient cultivator of the bunch. It also held its own as a tiller for breaking ground, but it tended to bounce a bit more over rocks and roots due to the lower handle angle.\\xa0\\nGet the Honda rototiller at Amazon or Lowe’s.\\nBest Front Tine\\nCraftsman 24\" 208cc Gas Front Tine Tiller\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\xa0\\nTraditional front tine rototillers offer the soil-churning power required for larger garden plots, along with convenient mobility for working around obstacles. This front tine tiller from Craftsman boasts an adjustable-width tine set and a 208cc gas engine, resulting in an abundance of power and versatility.\\nWeighing 116 pounds, this front tine tiller has plenty of weight to dig deep and prevent bouncing off hardpan soil and subsurface rocks. It can be configured to operate with two tines for a 13-inch tilling width or with four tines set at 22 or 24 inches wide. The recoil start system has an adjustable throttle lever with positive stops in the low and high settings. The tines are engaged by means of a grip lever on the left handle.\\xa0\\nThe Craftsman front tine tiller had plenty of power to turn the compacted soil in our established garden using the widest tine configuration and the deepest depth stake setting. To break new ground, we narrowed the tines to 22 inches and tilled at half depth. In both scenarios, the torque and tine speed were more than adequate.\\xa0\\nAs expected with front tine tillers, navigating curves and turns was much easier with this one than with a rear tine model. But the tradeoff was that the bumps and jostling we experienced when we encountered rocks and roots transitioned to our hands and bodies, increasing fatigue.\\nThe only fault we found in this machine was due to the configuration of the tine engagement lever. The user activates it by squeezing it against the left handle, but doing so tends to pinch the hand. The best solution is to wear gloves while tilling, but a better solution would be for Craftsman to redesign this feature to eliminate the pinch point.\\nGet the Craftsman rototiller at Lowe’s.\\nBest Small\\nKobalt 80V Lithium-Ion Cordless Electric Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 5/5; Performance 4/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\xa0\\nFor flower beds and raised-bed gardening, a small battery-powered rototiller is often the best tool for the job. The Kobalt 80-volt cordless electric cultivator is a perfect example. Powered by an 80-volt 2 Ah battery, it tills a path 10 inches wide and 5 inches deep. This small rototiller weighs only 29.2 pounds with the battery installed.\\xa0\\nIn addition to its maintenance-free electric motor, several features make this model a comfortable and convenient choice. The included rapid charger replenishes the battery in just 30 minutes. The padded loop handle offers a sturdy, comfortable, and slip-resistant grip. Starting the tiller is as easy as pushing a button and squeezing a lever—no choke, primer bulb, or pull cord is required. The modified pick-style tines make fast work of compacted, rocky soil.\\nRight out of the box, the Kobalt 80-volt cultivator impressed us with its compact size and sturdy feel. It was easy to assemble, charged fast, and did a great job preparing our compacted garden beds. From a comfort standpoint, we preferred loop-style handles like this one over the bicycle-style grips. For smaller tillers navigating narrow spaces, this type of handle seemed to offer better control.\\nAs with small battery-powered tillers, the pick tines and limitations of battery power were not well suited for breaking ground for new garden beds. This one is best for seasonal soil preparation and in-season garden maintenance.\\nGet the Kobalt rototiller at Lowe’s.\\nMost Versatile\\nEarthquake MC440 4-Cycle Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\xa0\\nSometimes, it’s tough to justify the purchase of a task-specific tool, but this tiller/cultivator combo’s optional add-on dethatching and edging kits make it a powerful multiuse machine. Use it to turn the soil in an existing garden or lift a portion of sod and till the hard soil underneath to create a new garden.\\xa0\\nAt 32 pounds, the 4-cycle gas-powered engine is lightweight and easy to maneuver across existing beds. Its front-mounted tines till up to 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide with each pass. Adjustable tines make transitioning from tilling to cultivating fast and efficient, while variable-speed controls apply more muscle when soil conditions call for it.\\xa0\\nAs a garden tiller, this model is well designed and easy to operate. During testing, we were able to turn 250 square feet of garden soil in just under 20 minutes. The handle design allowed us to exert more downward pressure as needed, keeping the tiller from bouncing around when the tines struck rocks and roots. It had plenty of torque to grind up new ground as well. As a cultivator, it was effective and nimble, but not as fast as some of the other models tested. The 4-point tines and 250 RPM speed equaled just 1,000 strikes per minute, whereas other models equipped with 10-point pick tines achieved 2,000 strikes per minute or more—even with fewer RPM.\\nGet the Earthquake rototiller at Amazon, Tractor Supply Co, Ace Hardware, Northern Tool + Equipment, or Earthquake.\\nJump to Our Top Picks\\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Rototiller\\nThere are a few shopping considerations to keep in mind when looking for the right rototiller for garden tasks. In particular, think about the power source, type of tines, size, and portability so that you can get the most out of your purchase.\\nTiller vs. Cultivator\\nThough the two terms are often used interchangeably, tillers and cultivators differ in functionality and purpose. When shopping, it’s important to understand which tool is more suitable for your specific gardening needs.\\nPower Source\\nTilling heavy soil by hand or with a shovel can be backbreaking work, but it doesn’t have to be tough when armed with the right rototiller.\\nIdeally, you’ll want to choose a rototiller with an engine that fits your landscaping goals. For smaller beds that require moderate cultivation, an electric rototiller will likely fit the bill. These tillers tend to be less powerful than their gas-powered counterparts, but they’re often lighter in weight and more compact. For creating new garden beds or working in heavy or compacted soil, a gas-powered tiller makes the work easier.\\nGas-powered tillers are larger and heavier than their electric counterparts, and their engines produce significantly more tilling power. Two-cycle gas engines require a fuel mixture of 2-cycle oil and gasoline. Four-cycle engines run on gas alone, which makes them cleaner and more environmentally friendly than 2-cycle engines.\\nCorded vs. Cordless\\nSome rototillers and cultivators can be powered by electricity through an electrical cord or by using battery power.\\nTines Positioning\\nRototillers vary in how the tines are positioned on the tool. Differences in the positioning of the tines affect how the soil is tilled.\\nWidth\\nMechanized tillers sometimes feature an adjustable tilling width and dig deeply into the soil (8 to 10 inches and sometimes deeper for new beds), effectively breaking up compacted or rocky soil. The wider the tiller, the more ground it can cover, which can result in fewer passes across the bed to prepare the soil.\\xa0\\nWidth is also a critical factor if the tiller will be used for cultivation during the growing season. You will want to either plant the garden with spacing that matches the width of the tiller or buy a tiller that can be adjusted to fit the width of existing garden rows and pathways.\\nWeight\\nCultivators and rototillers range in weight from less than 50 pounds to more than 200 pounds. The tiller’s weight directly impacts its maneuverability as well as its ability to break up compacted soil. And there are numerous convenience factors related to weight, such as the ability to transport, maintain, and store the machine. Consider buying one that is as lightweight as possible, but as heavy as necessary.\\nIf the tiller’s primary job will be breaking new ground and preparing the soil at the beginning of each growing season, then a heavier machine will make the most sense. On the other hand, if you will frequently use the tiller for weeding, cultivating, and incorporating soil amendments, then a lightweight cultivator could be the best option.\\nPortability\\nAs tillers increase in size, they also become more cumbersome and can be tough to operate in tight spots. For this reason, some tillers offer adjustable-height handles for maximum operating comfort or folding handles that make them easier to store.\\nMany buyers value both power and portability in tillers, but like most things, increased size means increased weight. For this reason, the best tiller should only be big enough to handle the task at hand. Otherwise, there may be operating and storing challenges.\\nFAQs\\nThese handy machines can help improve the yield of a garden and rejuvenate the lawn, but if you aren’t quite sure about the difference between tillers and cultivators or what type of rototiller would be ideal for your needs, continue reading. Several of the most commonly asked questions about the best garden tillers for new ground are answered below.\\nAs part of an overall garden management plan, one should determine whether or not their garden bed should be tilled, and if so, how frequently. The soil type and condition, soil moisture level, weather conditions, weed pressure, crop types, and other factors should influence the plan. That said, many gardeners find that deep tilling once ahead of the growing season is adequate, followed by occasional shallower tilling/cultivation one or more times through the growing season. Excessive tilling can do more harm than good.\\nIn general, rear tine tillers are preferred for large gardens or yards, while front tine tillers are better for a medium or small garden.\\nUsing a rototiller can be moderately strenuous, but it is usually not difficult. First, familiarize yourself with the controls. Plan your tilling route and adjust the machine’s tilling depth before beginning. After starting the engine, slide the throttle to the fast position and squeeze the engagement lever so that the tines begin to rotate. Working in parallel rows—along the contours if the area is on a slope—till the entire area. Turn the rototiller off and clean the tines.\\xa0\\nA rototiller can be helpful in many instances. For example, it can turn loose soil in the garden; break up hard, compact soil to prepare the ground for planting; or break through dying patches of lawn, killing off the old grass so that new grass can be planted. It can even be used to turn a compost pile.\\nThis depends on the needs of the user, but of all the garden cultivators we tested, our favorite was the Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller.\\xa0\\nMeet the Tester\\nMark Wolfe is a writer and product tester with a background in the nursery and landscaping industry.

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job.

Learn More ›\\nWhen it comes to gardening, a rototiller can save an incredible amount of time and effort. Good soil preparation is a key component to successful gardening, but manually turning the soil can be a slow, arduous process. That’s where rototillers come in handy. We tested seven rototillers of different sizes and prices, tilling more than 4,000 square feet of soil in the process. To find the best rototillers on the market, we used each tiller in a variety of ways, such as tilling existing garden beds, cultivating weedy garden paths, aerating compost piles, and breaking ground to create new garden spaces.\\xa0\\nA good rototiller or cultivator for any garden must be able to comfortably maneuver through the space while loosening and aerating compacted soil, removing weeds, and incorporating soil amendments. For some users’ needs, this may call for a small battery-powered cultivator, while others may require a large gas rototiller. Our favorite of the group, the Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller, turned a high volume of soil faster than any of the others. It was easy to operate for extended use, and it caused negligible physical strain and operator fatigue.\\xa0\\nThis guide includes large, medium, and small tillers and cultivators powered by gas and electricity. Each has been garden tested and evaluated for digging power, maneuverability, and user comfort. Whether your garden calls for a heavy-duty rear tine tiller, a powerful front tine model, or a compact garden cultivator, this roundup of the best rototillers could help you find the right one for your garden space.\\xa0\\nHow We Tested the Best Rototillers\\nRototillers are mostly used to turn brand-new ground that is currently covered with established vegetation, or for seasonal tilling and cultivation in an existing garden. We marked out two testing plots: 2,500 square feet in an existing garden and 1,500 square feet in an established lawn. After assembling the tillers, we used each one to turn up sections of both test plots—first at a shallow depth, then at the maximum depth.\\nAfter the test runs, we noted our observations on a scoring rubric. To be included in this guide, a tiller had to be comfortable to operate and powerful enough to penetrate hardpan soil. In addition to noting specifications like power ratings and dimensions, we assessed ease of use, performance, durability, and perceived value. Finally, we assigned superlative awards for each model that passed our criteria.\\xa0\\nOur Top Picks\\nA rototiller quickly turns hard-packed soil into a crumbly and plant-friendly haven. Whether you’re breaking new ground for an expansive veggie garden or refreshing a small flower bed for seasonal color, one of our tested tillers could be just the tool for the job. In the reviews ahead, find out how each model performed in testing.\\xa0\\nBest Overall\\nTroy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.5/5; Performance 5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\nOur top choice for the best rototiller came down to power. The Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT garden rototiller features a 208cc gas engine and counter-rotating rear tines that easily churn through compacted soil without bouncing around as it climbs over roots and rocks. In our tests, it performed the best in terms of breaking new ground. It made the toughest seasonal tilling projects incredibly easy.\\nThis tiller started up easily—normally on the first pull of the cord—and was easy to control with one hand. The tines had no problem grinding up our hard clay-based soil and returning it to the tilling path in a nice, crumbly texture. When it encountered larger rocks (up to the size of a baseball), the machine ejected them smoothly without jumping or surging.\\nThis is not the largest rear tine tiller on the market, as it has a maximum tilling width of 16 inches and tills 6 inches deep. But the relatively modest size was ideal for our rectangular 1,500-square-foot test garden. That being said, it is designed to work in long, straight lines. Navigating turns in small and oddly shaped beds became cumbersome.\\nGet the Troy-Bilt rototiller at Tractor Supply Co. or The Home Depot.\\nBest Bang for the Buck\\nToro 10\" 2-Cycle 43cc Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\nFor smaller garden beds that you don’t want to turn by hand, a compact and maneuverable tiller is necessary. This cultivator from Toro makes soil preparation and plant cultivation easier with the help of its lightweight, streamlined design. As a bonus, it has the lowest price of all the rototillers we tested.\\nThe cultivator features onboard wheels with a locking spring mechanism that lets the operator raise and lower them for improved depth control. The tiller can be used with all four tines in place or just the inner two, resulting in a 10-inch or 6-inch tilling width, respectively. The overhand design on the handles gives the operator greater control and reduces bucking over rocks and debris in the soil.\\nWe were pleasantly surprised to find that this garden cultivator actually operated much like a bigger rototiller, albeit with modified bolo-style tines and a slower rotation speed. It produced an impressive amount of torque for the size, which allowed it to break up compacted garden soil and root out weeds fairly easily. But unsurprisingly, it was underpowered and underweight for breaking new ground. The upright handle design definitely helped to reduce bucking, but it also transferred that energy to our hands, arms, and shoulders, so it’s best for working existing garden beds—or for busting up the clumps after breaking new ground with a spade.\\xa0\\nGet the Toro rototiller at Amazon, Lowe’s, Tractor Supply Co., or Ace Hardware.\\nBest Battery-Powered\\nGreenworks 10\" 40V Cordless Cultivator With Battery\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.8/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\xa0\\nThe Greenworks cordless electric cultivator has a 4-amp motor and comes with a battery charger and a 40-volt 4 amp hour (Ah) battery that can power the tiller for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. Instead of having to deal with the pull-cord start typical of gas-powered tillers, this battery rototiller has an easy-to-operate push-button start.\\nThe rototiller weighs about 21 pounds and is supported by a pair of 6-inch wheels for easy transport. The four front tines till to a maximum depth of 5 inches, and the tilling width is adjustable between 8.25 inches and 10 inches.\\xa0\\nWith modified pick tines capable of striking 2,000 times per minute, this cultivator moved quickly through our compacted garden soil. The smaller tilling area and shallow depth allowed us to safely cultivate near garden plants. It did a nice job of weeding as well as blending compost and fertilizer into the soil surface without damaging plant roots. However, like the other small tillers we tested, this one is not equipped to break ground in a brand-new garden bed.\\xa0\\nGet the Greenworks rototiller at Amazon, Northern Tool + Equipment, or Greenworks.\\nBest Cultivator\\nHonda 9\" Mini-Tiller/Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.8/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\nWhen it comes to outdoor power equipment, Honda consistently excels. The Honda FG110 mini tiller/cultivator is no exception. Powered by a clean-running commercial-grade GX25 engine, this model delivers surprisingly aggressive groundbreaking capabilities despite its small size. It packs the power to help with tough weeding chores, or to incorporate fertilizer and other soil amendments into the garden.\\nThis tiller features plow-style handlebars with an on/off switch conveniently located next to the hand grips. It comes with modified bolo-style 6-point tines that can be configured in either 6-inch or 9-inch widths. Moving at 294 RPM, they easily chew up weeds and compacted soil, as well as break ground for new garden beds.\\nWhile this was the most expensive of the three smallest gas rototillers we tested, it was also arguably the most capable. The 25cc engine produced higher RPM, and the tines chopped more aggressively through tough soil and weeds, making it the most efficient cultivator of the bunch. It also held its own as a tiller for breaking ground, but it tended to bounce a bit more over rocks and roots due to the lower handle angle.\\xa0\\nGet the Honda rototiller at Amazon or Lowe’s.\\nBest Front Tine\\nCraftsman 24\" 208cc Gas Front Tine Tiller\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\xa0\\nTraditional front tine rototillers offer the soil-churning power required for larger garden plots, along with convenient mobility for working around obstacles. This front tine tiller from Craftsman boasts an adjustable-width tine set and a 208cc gas engine, resulting in an abundance of power and versatility.\\nWeighing 116 pounds, this front tine tiller has plenty of weight to dig deep and prevent bouncing off hardpan soil and subsurface rocks. It can be configured to operate with two tines for a 13-inch tilling width or with four tines set at 22 or 24 inches wide. The recoil start system has an adjustable throttle lever with positive stops in the low and high settings. The tines are engaged by means of a grip lever on the left handle.\\xa0\\nThe Craftsman front tine tiller had plenty of power to turn the compacted soil in our established garden using the widest tine configuration and the deepest depth stake setting. To break new ground, we narrowed the tines to 22 inches and tilled at half depth. In both scenarios, the torque and tine speed were more than adequate.\\xa0\\nAs expected with front tine tillers, navigating curves and turns was much easier with this one than with a rear tine model. But the tradeoff was that the bumps and jostling we experienced when we encountered rocks and roots transitioned to our hands and bodies, increasing fatigue.\\nThe only fault we found in this machine was due to the configuration of the tine engagement lever. The user activates it by squeezing it against the left handle, but doing so tends to pinch the hand. The best solution is to wear gloves while tilling, but a better solution would be for Craftsman to redesign this feature to eliminate the pinch point.\\nGet the Craftsman rototiller at Lowe’s.\\nBest Small\\nKobalt 80V Lithium-Ion Cordless Electric Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 5/5; Performance 4/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\xa0\\nFor flower beds and raised-bed gardening, a small battery-powered rototiller is often the best tool for the job. The Kobalt 80-volt cordless electric cultivator is a perfect example. Powered by an 80-volt 2 Ah battery, it tills a path 10 inches wide and 5 inches deep. This small rototiller weighs only 29.2 pounds with the battery installed.\\xa0\\nIn addition to its maintenance-free electric motor, several features make this model a comfortable and convenient choice. The included rapid charger replenishes the battery in just 30 minutes. The padded loop handle offers a sturdy, comfortable, and slip-resistant grip. Starting the tiller is as easy as pushing a button and squeezing a lever—no choke, primer bulb, or pull cord is required. The modified pick-style tines make fast work of compacted, rocky soil.\\nRight out of the box, the Kobalt 80-volt cultivator impressed us with its compact size and sturdy feel. It was easy to assemble, charged fast, and did a great job preparing our compacted garden beds. From a comfort standpoint, we preferred loop-style handles like this one over the bicycle-style grips. For smaller tillers navigating narrow spaces, this type of handle seemed to offer better control.\\nAs with small battery-powered tillers, the pick tines and limitations of battery power were not well suited for breaking ground for new garden beds. This one is best for seasonal soil preparation and in-season garden maintenance.\\nGet the Kobalt rototiller at Lowe’s.\\nMost Versatile\\nEarthquake MC440 4-Cycle Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\xa0\\nSometimes, it’s tough to justify the purchase of a task-specific tool, but this tiller/cultivator combo’s optional add-on dethatching and edging kits make it a powerful multiuse machine. Use it to turn the soil in an existing garden or lift a portion of sod and till the hard soil underneath to create a new garden.\\xa0\\nAt 32 pounds, the 4-cycle gas-powered engine is lightweight and easy to maneuver across existing beds. Its front-mounted tines till up to 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide with each pass. Adjustable tines make transitioning from tilling to cultivating fast and efficient, while variable-speed controls apply more muscle when soil conditions call for it.\\xa0\\nAs a garden tiller, this model is well designed and easy to operate. During testing, we were able to turn 250 square feet of garden soil in just under 20 minutes. The handle design allowed us to exert more downward pressure as needed, keeping the tiller from bouncing around when the tines struck rocks and roots. It had plenty of torque to grind up new ground as well. As a cultivator, it was effective and nimble, but not as fast as some of the other models tested. The 4-point tines and 250 RPM speed equaled just 1,000 strikes per minute, whereas other models equipped with 10-point pick tines achieved 2,000 strikes per minute or more—even with fewer RPM.\\nGet the Earthquake rototiller at Amazon, Tractor Supply Co, Ace Hardware, Northern Tool + Equipment, or Earthquake.\\nJump to Our Top Picks\\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Rototiller\\nThere are a few shopping considerations to keep in mind when looking for the right rototiller for garden tasks. In particular, think about the power source, type of tines, size, and portability so that you can get the most out of your purchase.\\nTiller vs. Cultivator\\nThough the two terms are often used interchangeably, tillers and cultivators differ in functionality and purpose. When shopping, it’s important to understand which tool is more suitable for your specific gardening needs.\\nPower Source\\nTilling heavy soil by hand or with a shovel can be backbreaking work, but it doesn’t have to be tough when armed with the right rototiller.\\nIdeally, you’ll want to choose a rototiller with an engine that fits your landscaping goals. For smaller beds that require moderate cultivation, an electric rototiller will likely fit the bill. These tillers tend to be less powerful than their gas-powered counterparts, but they’re often lighter in weight and more compact. For creating new garden beds or working in heavy or compacted soil, a gas-powered tiller makes the work easier.\\nGas-powered tillers are larger and heavier than their electric counterparts, and their engines produce significantly more tilling power. Two-cycle gas engines require a fuel mixture of 2-cycle oil and gasoline. Four-cycle engines run on gas alone, which makes them cleaner and more environmentally friendly than 2-cycle engines.\\nCorded vs. Cordless\\nSome rototillers and cultivators can be powered by electricity through an electrical cord or by using battery power.\\nTines Positioning\\nRototillers vary in how the tines are positioned on the tool. Differences in the positioning of the tines affect how the soil is tilled.\\nWidth\\nMechanized tillers sometimes feature an adjustable tilling width and dig deeply into the soil (8 to 10 inches and sometimes deeper for new beds), effectively breaking up compacted or rocky soil. The wider the tiller, the more ground it can cover, which can result in fewer passes across the bed to prepare the soil.\\xa0\\nWidth is also a critical factor if the tiller will be used for cultivation during the growing season. You will want to either plant the garden with spacing that matches the width of the tiller or buy a tiller that can be adjusted to fit the width of existing garden rows and pathways.\\nWeight\\nCultivators and rototillers range in weight from less than 50 pounds to more than 200 pounds. The tiller’s weight directly impacts its maneuverability as well as its ability to break up compacted soil. And there are numerous convenience factors related to weight, such as the ability to transport, maintain, and store the machine. Consider buying one that is as lightweight as possible, but as heavy as necessary.\\nIf the tiller’s primary job will be breaking new ground and preparing the soil at the beginning of each growing season, then a heavier machine will make the most sense. On the other hand, if you will frequently use the tiller for weeding, cultivating, and incorporating soil amendments, then a lightweight cultivator could be the best option.\\nPortability\\nAs tillers increase in size, they also become more cumbersome and can be tough to operate in tight spots. For this reason, some tillers offer adjustable-height handles for maximum operating comfort or folding handles that make them easier to store.\\nMany buyers value both power and portability in tillers, but like most things, increased size means increased weight. For this reason, the best tiller should only be big enough to handle the task at hand. Otherwise, there may be operating and storing challenges.\\nFAQs\\nThese handy machines can help improve the yield of a garden and rejuvenate the lawn, but if you aren’t quite sure about the difference between tillers and cultivators or what type of rototiller would be ideal for your needs, continue reading. Several of the most commonly asked questions about the best garden tillers for new ground are answered below.\\nAs part of an overall garden management plan, one should determine whether or not their garden bed should be tilled, and if so, how frequently. The soil type and condition, soil moisture level, weather conditions, weed pressure, crop types, and other factors should influence the plan. That said, many gardeners find that deep tilling once ahead of the growing season is adequate, followed by occasional shallower tilling/cultivation one or more times through the growing season. Excessive tilling can do more harm than good.\\nIn general, rear tine tillers are preferred for large gardens or yards, while front tine tillers are better for a medium or small garden.\\nUsing a rototiller can be moderately strenuous, but it is usually not difficult. First, familiarize yourself with the controls. Plan your tilling route and adjust the machine’s tilling depth before beginning. After starting the engine, slide the throttle to the fast position and squeeze the engagement lever so that the tines begin to rotate. Working in parallel rows—along the contours if the area is on a slope—till the entire area. Turn the rototiller off and clean the tines.\\xa0\\nA rototiller can be helpful in many instances. For example, it can turn loose soil in the garden; break up hard, compact soil to prepare the ground for planting; or break through dying patches of lawn, killing off the old grass so that new grass can be planted. It can even be used to turn a compost pile.\\nThis depends on the needs of the user, but of all the garden cultivators we tested, our favorite was the Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller.\\xa0\\nMeet the Tester\\nMark Wolfe is a writer and product tester with a background in the nursery and landscaping industry.

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?

Learn More ›\\nWhen it comes to gardening, a rototiller can save an incredible amount of time and effort. Good soil preparation is a key component to successful gardening, but manually turning the soil can be a slow, arduous process. That’s where rototillers come in handy. We tested seven rototillers of different sizes and prices, tilling more than 4,000 square feet of soil in the process. To find the best rototillers on the market, we used each tiller in a variety of ways, such as tilling existing garden beds, cultivating weedy garden paths, aerating compost piles, and breaking ground to create new garden spaces.\\xa0\\nA good rototiller or cultivator for any garden must be able to comfortably maneuver through the space while loosening and aerating compacted soil, removing weeds, and incorporating soil amendments. For some users’ needs, this may call for a small battery-powered cultivator, while others may require a large gas rototiller. Our favorite of the group, the Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller, turned a high volume of soil faster than any of the others. It was easy to operate for extended use, and it caused negligible physical strain and operator fatigue.\\xa0\\nThis guide includes large, medium, and small tillers and cultivators powered by gas and electricity. Each has been garden tested and evaluated for digging power, maneuverability, and user comfort. Whether your garden calls for a heavy-duty rear tine tiller, a powerful front tine model, or a compact garden cultivator, this roundup of the best rototillers could help you find the right one for your garden space.\\xa0\\nHow We Tested the Best Rototillers\\nRototillers are mostly used to turn brand-new ground that is currently covered with established vegetation, or for seasonal tilling and cultivation in an existing garden. We marked out two testing plots: 2,500 square feet in an existing garden and 1,500 square feet in an established lawn. After assembling the tillers, we used each one to turn up sections of both test plots—first at a shallow depth, then at the maximum depth.\\nAfter the test runs, we noted our observations on a scoring rubric. To be included in this guide, a tiller had to be comfortable to operate and powerful enough to penetrate hardpan soil. In addition to noting specifications like power ratings and dimensions, we assessed ease of use, performance, durability, and perceived value. Finally, we assigned superlative awards for each model that passed our criteria.\\xa0\\nOur Top Picks\\nA rototiller quickly turns hard-packed soil into a crumbly and plant-friendly haven. Whether you’re breaking new ground for an expansive veggie garden or refreshing a small flower bed for seasonal color, one of our tested tillers could be just the tool for the job. In the reviews ahead, find out how each model performed in testing.\\xa0\\nBest Overall\\nTroy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.5/5; Performance 5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\nOur top choice for the best rototiller came down to power. The Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT garden rototiller features a 208cc gas engine and counter-rotating rear tines that easily churn through compacted soil without bouncing around as it climbs over roots and rocks. In our tests, it performed the best in terms of breaking new ground. It made the toughest seasonal tilling projects incredibly easy.\\nThis tiller started up easily—normally on the first pull of the cord—and was easy to control with one hand. The tines had no problem grinding up our hard clay-based soil and returning it to the tilling path in a nice, crumbly texture. When it encountered larger rocks (up to the size of a baseball), the machine ejected them smoothly without jumping or surging.\\nThis is not the largest rear tine tiller on the market, as it has a maximum tilling width of 16 inches and tills 6 inches deep. But the relatively modest size was ideal for our rectangular 1,500-square-foot test garden. That being said, it is designed to work in long, straight lines. Navigating turns in small and oddly shaped beds became cumbersome.\\nGet the Troy-Bilt rototiller at Tractor Supply Co. or The Home Depot.\\nBest Bang for the Buck\\nToro 10\" 2-Cycle 43cc Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\nFor smaller garden beds that you don’t want to turn by hand, a compact and maneuverable tiller is necessary. This cultivator from Toro makes soil preparation and plant cultivation easier with the help of its lightweight, streamlined design. As a bonus, it has the lowest price of all the rototillers we tested.\\nThe cultivator features onboard wheels with a locking spring mechanism that lets the operator raise and lower them for improved depth control. The tiller can be used with all four tines in place or just the inner two, resulting in a 10-inch or 6-inch tilling width, respectively. The overhand design on the handles gives the operator greater control and reduces bucking over rocks and debris in the soil.\\nWe were pleasantly surprised to find that this garden cultivator actually operated much like a bigger rototiller, albeit with modified bolo-style tines and a slower rotation speed. It produced an impressive amount of torque for the size, which allowed it to break up compacted garden soil and root out weeds fairly easily. But unsurprisingly, it was underpowered and underweight for breaking new ground. The upright handle design definitely helped to reduce bucking, but it also transferred that energy to our hands, arms, and shoulders, so it’s best for working existing garden beds—or for busting up the clumps after breaking new ground with a spade.\\xa0\\nGet the Toro rototiller at Amazon, Lowe’s, Tractor Supply Co., or Ace Hardware.\\nBest Battery-Powered\\nGreenworks 10\" 40V Cordless Cultivator With Battery\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.8/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\xa0\\nThe Greenworks cordless electric cultivator has a 4-amp motor and comes with a battery charger and a 40-volt 4 amp hour (Ah) battery that can power the tiller for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. Instead of having to deal with the pull-cord start typical of gas-powered tillers, this battery rototiller has an easy-to-operate push-button start.\\nThe rototiller weighs about 21 pounds and is supported by a pair of 6-inch wheels for easy transport. The four front tines till to a maximum depth of 5 inches, and the tilling width is adjustable between 8.25 inches and 10 inches.\\xa0\\nWith modified pick tines capable of striking 2,000 times per minute, this cultivator moved quickly through our compacted garden soil. The smaller tilling area and shallow depth allowed us to safely cultivate near garden plants. It did a nice job of weeding as well as blending compost and fertilizer into the soil surface without damaging plant roots. However, like the other small tillers we tested, this one is not equipped to break ground in a brand-new garden bed.\\xa0\\nGet the Greenworks rototiller at Amazon, Northern Tool + Equipment, or Greenworks.\\nBest Cultivator\\nHonda 9\" Mini-Tiller/Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.8/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\nWhen it comes to outdoor power equipment, Honda consistently excels. The Honda FG110 mini tiller/cultivator is no exception. Powered by a clean-running commercial-grade GX25 engine, this model delivers surprisingly aggressive groundbreaking capabilities despite its small size. It packs the power to help with tough weeding chores, or to incorporate fertilizer and other soil amendments into the garden.\\nThis tiller features plow-style handlebars with an on/off switch conveniently located next to the hand grips. It comes with modified bolo-style 6-point tines that can be configured in either 6-inch or 9-inch widths. Moving at 294 RPM, they easily chew up weeds and compacted soil, as well as break ground for new garden beds.\\nWhile this was the most expensive of the three smallest gas rototillers we tested, it was also arguably the most capable. The 25cc engine produced higher RPM, and the tines chopped more aggressively through tough soil and weeds, making it the most efficient cultivator of the bunch. It also held its own as a tiller for breaking ground, but it tended to bounce a bit more over rocks and roots due to the lower handle angle.\\xa0\\nGet the Honda rototiller at Amazon or Lowe’s.\\nBest Front Tine\\nCraftsman 24\" 208cc Gas Front Tine Tiller\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\xa0\\nTraditional front tine rototillers offer the soil-churning power required for larger garden plots, along with convenient mobility for working around obstacles. This front tine tiller from Craftsman boasts an adjustable-width tine set and a 208cc gas engine, resulting in an abundance of power and versatility.\\nWeighing 116 pounds, this front tine tiller has plenty of weight to dig deep and prevent bouncing off hardpan soil and subsurface rocks. It can be configured to operate with two tines for a 13-inch tilling width or with four tines set at 22 or 24 inches wide. The recoil start system has an adjustable throttle lever with positive stops in the low and high settings. The tines are engaged by means of a grip lever on the left handle.\\xa0\\nThe Craftsman front tine tiller had plenty of power to turn the compacted soil in our established garden using the widest tine configuration and the deepest depth stake setting. To break new ground, we narrowed the tines to 22 inches and tilled at half depth. In both scenarios, the torque and tine speed were more than adequate.\\xa0\\nAs expected with front tine tillers, navigating curves and turns was much easier with this one than with a rear tine model. But the tradeoff was that the bumps and jostling we experienced when we encountered rocks and roots transitioned to our hands and bodies, increasing fatigue.\\nThe only fault we found in this machine was due to the configuration of the tine engagement lever. The user activates it by squeezing it against the left handle, but doing so tends to pinch the hand. The best solution is to wear gloves while tilling, but a better solution would be for Craftsman to redesign this feature to eliminate the pinch point.\\nGet the Craftsman rototiller at Lowe’s.\\nBest Small\\nKobalt 80V Lithium-Ion Cordless Electric Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 5/5; Performance 4/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.3/5\\xa0\\nFor flower beds and raised-bed gardening, a small battery-powered rototiller is often the best tool for the job. The Kobalt 80-volt cordless electric cultivator is a perfect example. Powered by an 80-volt 2 Ah battery, it tills a path 10 inches wide and 5 inches deep. This small rototiller weighs only 29.2 pounds with the battery installed.\\xa0\\nIn addition to its maintenance-free electric motor, several features make this model a comfortable and convenient choice. The included rapid charger replenishes the battery in just 30 minutes. The padded loop handle offers a sturdy, comfortable, and slip-resistant grip. Starting the tiller is as easy as pushing a button and squeezing a lever—no choke, primer bulb, or pull cord is required. The modified pick-style tines make fast work of compacted, rocky soil.\\nRight out of the box, the Kobalt 80-volt cultivator impressed us with its compact size and sturdy feel. It was easy to assemble, charged fast, and did a great job preparing our compacted garden beds. From a comfort standpoint, we preferred loop-style handles like this one over the bicycle-style grips. For smaller tillers navigating narrow spaces, this type of handle seemed to offer better control.\\nAs with small battery-powered tillers, the pick tines and limitations of battery power were not well suited for breaking ground for new garden beds. This one is best for seasonal soil preparation and in-season garden maintenance.\\nGet the Kobalt rototiller at Lowe’s.\\nMost Versatile\\nEarthquake MC440 4-Cycle Cultivator\\nOur Ratings: Ease of Use 4.3/5; Performance 4.5/5; Durability 5/5; Value 4.7/5\\xa0\\nSometimes, it’s tough to justify the purchase of a task-specific tool, but this tiller/cultivator combo’s optional add-on dethatching and edging kits make it a powerful multiuse machine. Use it to turn the soil in an existing garden or lift a portion of sod and till the hard soil underneath to create a new garden.\\xa0\\nAt 32 pounds, the 4-cycle gas-powered engine is lightweight and easy to maneuver across existing beds. Its front-mounted tines till up to 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide with each pass. Adjustable tines make transitioning from tilling to cultivating fast and efficient, while variable-speed controls apply more muscle when soil conditions call for it.\\xa0\\nAs a garden tiller, this model is well designed and easy to operate. During testing, we were able to turn 250 square feet of garden soil in just under 20 minutes. The handle design allowed us to exert more downward pressure as needed, keeping the tiller from bouncing around when the tines struck rocks and roots. It had plenty of torque to grind up new ground as well. As a cultivator, it was effective and nimble, but not as fast as some of the other models tested. The 4-point tines and 250 RPM speed equaled just 1,000 strikes per minute, whereas other models equipped with 10-point pick tines achieved 2,000 strikes per minute or more—even with fewer RPM.\\nGet the Earthquake rototiller at Amazon, Tractor Supply Co, Ace Hardware, Northern Tool + Equipment, or Earthquake.\\nJump to Our Top Picks\\nWhat to Consider When Choosing a Rototiller\\nThere are a few shopping considerations to keep in mind when looking for the right rototiller for garden tasks. In particular, think about the power source, type of tines, size, and portability so that you can get the most out of your purchase.\\nTiller vs. Cultivator\\nThough the two terms are often used interchangeably, tillers and cultivators differ in functionality and purpose. When shopping, it’s important to understand which tool is more suitable for your specific gardening needs.\\nPower Source\\nTilling heavy soil by hand or with a shovel can be backbreaking work, but it doesn’t have to be tough when armed with the right rototiller.\\nIdeally, you’ll want to choose a rototiller with an engine that fits your landscaping goals. For smaller beds that require moderate cultivation, an electric rototiller will likely fit the bill. These tillers tend to be less powerful than their gas-powered counterparts, but they’re often lighter in weight and more compact. For creating new garden beds or working in heavy or compacted soil, a gas-powered tiller makes the work easier.\\nGas-powered tillers are larger and heavier than their electric counterparts, and their engines produce significantly more tilling power. Two-cycle gas engines require a fuel mixture of 2-cycle oil and gasoline. Four-cycle engines run on gas alone, which makes them cleaner and more environmentally friendly than 2-cycle engines.\\nCorded vs. Cordless\\nSome rototillers and cultivators can be powered by electricity through an electrical cord or by using battery power.\\nTines Positioning\\nRototillers vary in how the tines are positioned on the tool. Differences in the positioning of the tines affect how the soil is tilled.\\nWidth\\nMechanized tillers sometimes feature an adjustable tilling width and dig deeply into the soil (8 to 10 inches and sometimes deeper for new beds), effectively breaking up compacted or rocky soil. The wider the tiller, the more ground it can cover, which can result in fewer passes across the bed to prepare the soil.\\xa0\\nWidth is also a critical factor if the tiller will be used for cultivation during the growing season. You will want to either plant the garden with spacing that matches the width of the tiller or buy a tiller that can be adjusted to fit the width of existing garden rows and pathways.\\nWeight\\nCultivators and rototillers range in weight from less than 50 pounds to more than 200 pounds. The tiller’s weight directly impacts its maneuverability as well as its ability to break up compacted soil. And there are numerous convenience factors related to weight, such as the ability to transport, maintain, and store the machine. Consider buying one that is as lightweight as possible, but as heavy as necessary.\\nIf the tiller’s primary job will be breaking new ground and preparing the soil at the beginning of each growing season, then a heavier machine will make the most sense. On the other hand, if you will frequently use the tiller for weeding, cultivating, and incorporating soil amendments, then a lightweight cultivator could be the best option.\\nPortability\\nAs tillers increase in size, they also become more cumbersome and can be tough to operate in tight spots. For this reason, some tillers offer adjustable-height handles for maximum operating comfort or folding handles that make them easier to store.\\nMany buyers value both power and portability in tillers, but like most things, increased size means increased weight. For this reason, the best tiller should only be big enough to handle the task at hand. Otherwise, there may be operating and storing challenges.\\nFAQs\\nThese handy machines can help improve the yield of a garden and rejuvenate the lawn, but if you aren’t quite sure about the difference between tillers and cultivators or what type of rototiller would be ideal for your needs, continue reading. Several of the most commonly asked questions about the best garden tillers for new ground are answered below.\\nAs part of an overall garden management plan, one should determine whether or not their garden bed should be tilled, and if so, how frequently. The soil type and condition, soil moisture level, weather conditions, weed pressure, crop types, and other factors should influence the plan. That said, many gardeners find that deep tilling once ahead of the growing season is adequate, followed by occasional shallower tilling/cultivation one or more times through the growing season. Excessive tilling can do more harm than good.\\nIn general, rear tine tillers are preferred for large gardens or yards, while front tine tillers are better for a medium or small garden.\\nUsing a rototiller can be moderately strenuous, but it is usually not difficult. First, familiarize yourself with the controls. Plan your tilling route and adjust the machine’s tilling depth before beginning. After starting the engine, slide the throttle to the fast position and squeeze the engagement lever so that the tines begin to rotate. Working in parallel rows—along the contours if the area is on a slope—till the entire area. Turn the rototiller off and clean the tines.\\xa0\\nA rototiller can be helpful in many instances. For example, it can turn loose soil in the garden; break up hard, compact soil to prepare the ground for planting; or break through dying patches of lawn, killing off the old grass so that new grass can be planted. It can even be used to turn a compost pile.\\nThis depends on the needs of the user, but of all the garden cultivators we tested, our favorite was the Troy-Bilt Super Bronco CRT Garden Tiller.\\xa0\\nMeet the Tester\\nMark Wolfe is a writer and product tester with a background in the nursery and landscaping industry.

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?

Can a rototiller be used in rocky soil?\\nA. Running a rototiller over rock can damage the tines. It is best to remove rocks by hand.\\nQ. Can a rototiller remove tree roots from the soil?\\nA. Rototillers will not break up large roots.\\nQ. How deep do rototillers dig?\\nA. A rear-tine, gas-powered rototiller can dig 8 to 10 inches deep.

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\\nLearn more.\\nThe 13 Best Tillers of 2023\\nThe Greenworks 40V 10 inch Cordless Cultivator is our top pick\\nThe Spruce / Kevin Liang\\nA tiller reduces the time and effort it takes to prepare your soil for planting, especially if the soil is compacted or rocky. When selecting a tiller, keep in mind the size of your garden. “A front-tine tiller is smaller, lighter, and easy to maneuver. Most people find them convenient to use and they are ideal for small to medium-sized gardens, and gardens with tight corners,” notes Kris Kiser, president, and CEO of Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI).\\nFrom compact, electric models to heavy-duty, gas-powered tillers, you\\'ll find plenty of options available to suit your specific needs. When researching the best tillers, we evaluated products based on their type, size, tilling width and depth, portability, and power source.\\nBest Overall\\nGreenworks 40V 10-Inch Cordless Tiller and Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nRuns up to 40 minutes on a single charge\\nQuick charging time\\nAdjustable tilling width\\nEasy push-button start\\nSome reports of missing parts or pieces\\nThis cordless electric tiller from Greenworks is our best overall pick, because it is simple to use, is quick to charge, has an adjustable width, and is easy to maintain. It is equipped with a 40-volt battery, which allows it to run for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. The runtime can be extended even longer if you have additional batteries. It only takes two hours for the batteries to completely charge. The four front tines can till as deep as five inches, and the tilling width is adjustable between 8.25 inches and 10 inches.\\nThanks to a push-button start, it’s a cinch to get this front-tine tiller going. For added safety, it has a cut-off switch to prevent accidental startups. At 21 pounds, the Greenworks cordless electric cultivator is fairly lightweight, and the two rear wheels support a good portion of its weight.\\nRequiring no gas or oil, this battery-powered unit is practically maintenance-free. It’s also quieter, and it has a lot less vibration than gas-powered models. We read some reports of missing parts, so be sure to inspect your tiller thoroughly upon arrival. The manufacturer offers three year-warranties on both the tool and batteries.\\nPrice at time of publish: $270\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 8.25 to 10 inches | Tilling Depth: 5 inches | Power Source: Cordless electric | Weight: 21 pounds\\nBest Budget\\nEarthwise TC70001 11-Inch 8.5-Amp Electric Tiller\\nAmazon\\nTiller and cultivator all-in-one\\nLightweight and easy to maneuver\\nSoft, ergonomic handle\\nOnly one speed\\nA few reports of breakdowns\\nThis corded electric tiller from Earthwise is an affordably priced option that’s ideal for small to medium-sized gardens. The four front tines can till up to 11 inches wide and 8 inches deep. Powered by an 8.5-amp motor, this rototiller will run as long as you need it to once it’s plugged into an outlet. The single-lever switch is easy to operate, ensuring that the engine starts right up every time.\\nAt just 27 pounds, this unit is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It also has an ergonomic, V-shaped handle that provides a comfortable grip and better maneuverability. Another convenient feature is a cord-retention hook for uninterrupted tilling power. Best of all, the Earthwise electric tiller delivers a powerful performance without gas or fumes.\\nNote that this unit can only be operated at one speed. Although it’s powerful, you can’t increase the pace when the conditions call for it. We have read a small number of reports that say the tiller stopped working very quickly. Be sure to take advantage of the two-year warranty if you encounter any problems or defects.\\nPrice at time of publish: $140\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 11 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Corded electric | Weight: 27 pounds\\nBest Compact\\nMantis 4-Cycle Tiller Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nSleek, space-saving design\\nLightweight and easy to carry\\nErgonomic, foldable handle\\nAdjustable tilling depth\\nRequires regular refills\\nSome reports of broken parts\\nThis mini tiller from Mantis has a slim profile that will take up minimal space in a garage or shed. At just 24 pounds, this tool is extremely lightweight and easy to transport. It features ergonomically flared handles for comfortable operation. The handles fold down for easy carrying and storage. It has powerful, four-blade steel tines and the tilling depth is adjustable from 3 to 10 inches. With a 9–inch tilling width, this compact machine can get into tight spots that a larger tiller can’t reach.\\nThe Mantis Tiller Cultivator has a four-cycle engine and requires both gas and oil for operation. Like any model in this category, you will need to keep an eye on the fluid levels. It has a recoil start, which is a bit trickier to operate than a push-button start. We have read some reports of the tiller breaking or bending after several uses. The good news is that this product is backed by a two-year warranty to protect your investment.\\nPrice at time of publish: $399\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 9 inches | Tilling Depth: 10 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 24 pounds\\nBest Cultivator\\nGardenTrax Mini Tiller Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nWeeds, mixes, and aerates all at once\\nAdjustable tilling width\\nPowerful engine for deep tilling\\nNot suitable for hard ground\\nEngine may take a while to start\\nThe Garden Trax cultivator is a versatile machine that’s able to weed, mix, and aerate soil at the same time. Its tilling width can be adjusted from 6 to 12 inches, allowing you to work in areas of various sizes. The gas-powered, two-cycle engine delivers enough power for deep tilling (up to 6 inches). Just keep in mind that this front-tine cultivator isn’t intended to break up hard ground. It does a great job of prepping the soil before planting, however.\\nAt 33 pounds, the Garden Trax is one of the heaviest tillers in our roundup. Luckily, the two adjustable wheels absorb most of the weight and make it easy to maneuver. Note that this tiller is equipped with a manual recoil, rather than a push-button start, which may take longer to get going.\\nPrice at time of publish: $200\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 6 to 12 inches | Tilling Depth: 6 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 33 pounds\\nBest for Large Gardens\\nChampion Power Equipment 100379 22 in. Front Tine Tiller\\nCompact design with stored wheels\\nIdeal for larger gardens\\nAdjustable tilling width and depth\\nRequires regular refills\\nSome reports of broken parts\\nWith an adjustable tilling depth of up to 8 inches, the Champion 100379 is ideal for preparing large flower beds and vegetable gardens. The tilling width is adjustable between 16 to 22 inches, allowing you to weed between wide rows. This versatile electric tiller has a slim profile and flip-down wheels, so it’s easy to store when not in use. The compact design and stored wheels make it easy to transport across driveways and sidewalks. A 212cc engine powers four heavy-duty steel tines with dual rotation, which can break up hard ground and turn it into viable soil.\\nNote that this tiller uses gasoline and oil, which will require regular refills. You’ll have to keep an eye on the levels, but it is equipped with a low-oil shut-off sensor. We have read some reports that the tiller stopped working in a short period of time. To ensure customer satisfaction, Champion backs this product with a two-year limited warranty and free lifetime technical support.\\nPrice at time of publish: $799\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 22 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 119.1 pounds\\nBest for Small Gardens\\nBlack+Decker 20V Max Cordless Garden Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nIdeal for small gardens\\nCordless convenience\\nLightweight and easy to maneuver\\nErgonomic, telescoping handle\\nLess powerful than other options\\nBattery takes a while to recharge\\nFor existing gardens that only require a minimal amount of cultivating, the BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Tiller is a great choice. This affordably priced tiller/cultivator is ideal for smaller areas, and it can till up to 325 square feet on a single charge. Powered by a 20-volt lithium-ion battery, this cordless model is convenient and portable. Counter-oscillating tines quickly eliminate weeds and prevent them from tangling. The soft-grip, telescoping handle makes it comfortable to hold for longer periods of time.\\nAt just over 8 pounds, this BLACK+DECKER tiller is lightweight and easy to maneuver.\\xa0 We have read some complaints that the battery life is a bit shorter than expected and that it can take up to eight hours to fully recharge. Also note that with a maximum cultivating depth of four inches, this tool is limited for use on softer garden soil and shallower weeds, but we think for smaller gardens with the right soil, this budget-friendly tiller is a great choice.\\nPrice at time of publish: $87\\nType: Not listed | Tilling Width: 7 inches | Tilling Depth: 4 inches | Power Source: Cordless electric | Weight: 8.1 pounds\\nBest Combo\\nEarthquake 12802 MC440 Mini Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nAdjustable tines for multiple tasks\\nVariable speeds\\nEasy to maneuver\\nOptional edger and dethatcher kit (sold separately)\\nCan be tricky to start\\nThis tiller/cultivator combo can be used with an optional edging or dethatching kit, making it a great multipurpose option. Its four-cycle, gas-powered engine delivers plenty of power, allowing you to work through all types of pre-tilled earth. The four front tines can till up to 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide, and since they’re adjustable, you can easily switch between tilling and cultivating modes. This unit offers variable speed controls too, so you can increase the power to tackle tough terrain.\\nDespite all its power, the Earthquake Mini Cultivator is relatively lightweight at 32 pounds and easy to maneuver. This unit features an air filter that helps to keep damaging debris out of the engine. However, we have read some complaints that the pull-cord start can be tricky to operate. It comes with a five-year warranty to ensure years of reliable use, though some customers report difficulties with customer service.\\nPrice at time of publish: $269\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 10 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 32 pounds\\nBest Adjustable Depth\\nSun Joe TJ602E 12-Inch 8-Amp Electric Garden Tiller/Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nAdjustable digging depth\\nFast 300 rpm speed\\nThree-position wheel adjustment\\nFoldable handle for convenient storage\\nOnly one speed\\nCord limits portability\\nThis electric rototiller from Sun Joe allows you to adjust the digging depth up to 8 inches, which helps to break up rocky or compacted soil. It has four steel angled tines and a powerful 8-amp motor that cultivates up to 12 inches wide. Other convenient features include three-position, height-adjustable rear wheels and dual handles for easy maneuvering. When not in use, the frame collapses for compact storage in a garage or shed.\\nNote that this rototiller is corded, which means it’s less portable than other models. It only operates in one speed mode, but at 300 rpm, it can slice through heavy soil quickly and easily. We read some reports of the motor and blades breaking within a short period of time. The good news is that this product is backed by a two-year warranty, and the manufacturer will send a replacement with no questions asked.\\nPrice at time of publish: $116\\nType: Rear Tine | Tilling Width: 12 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Electric | Weight: 23.15 pounds\\nBest Gas\\nTazz 35310 2-in-1 Front Tine Tiller/Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nVery powerful\\nConvenient\\nTwo-in-one design\\nAdjustable tilling width and depth\\nHandle adjusts to four different heights\\nRequires regular refills\\nSome reports of broken parts\\nWith a powerful yet fuel efficient 79cc Viper engine, this gas-powered model is designed for heavy-duty jobs. The tilling depth is adjustable up to 11 inches, and the forged steel tines can easily break up dense soil. By removing the outer tines and side shields, this unit quickly transforms from a tiller into a cultivator. The tilling width is also adjustable between 21 and 11 inches, giving you more coverage as your garden grows. At a whopping 85.8 pounds, this machine may sound extremely heavy, but it’s easy to maneuver, thanks to a low center of gravity and excellent stability.\\nThe steel handlebar has four height positions, so users can comfortably steer it without having to bend over. Keep in mind that this powerful tool consumes a good amount of gas and oil. You’ll need to monitor the levels on a regular basis. The Tazz 35310 is one of the most expensive options on our list, but it also offers superior power and a convenient, two-in-one design. We have read some reports of pieces breaking in a short period of time. However, this product is backed by a three-year warranty to protect your investment.\\nPrice at time of publish: $325\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 21 inches | Tilling Depth: 11 inches | Power Source: Gas | Weight: 85.8 pounds\\nBest Heavy-Duty\\nEarthquake 37037 Pioneer Dual-Direction Rear Tine Tiller\\nAmazon\\nExtremely powerful\\nDual-direction tines\\nEasy to shift\\nInstant reverse\\nVery expensive\\nBulkier than other options\\nThe Earthquake Pioneer Dual-Direction Rear Tine Tiller can handle your toughest tilling jobs. Equipped with a 99cc 4-cycle Viper engine, it can break through hard ground and heavily compacted soil with ease. The dual-direction design allows you to operate in two modes: Counter-rotating tines can bust sod and till hard soil, while standard-rotating tines are ideal for mixing tilled soil. Plus, it can till up to 11.25 inches deep and 17 inches wide. This gas-powered tiller is easy to shift and goes into reverse almost immediately with the pull of a handle.\\nIt’s no big surprise that all this power and convenience comes at a steep cost. The Earthquake Pioneer is the most expensive option in our roundup, but its strength is unparalleled At 160 pounds, it’s also the heaviest tiller on our list. Thanks to dual control handlebars and a low center of gravity, however, this machine rides smoothly and maneuvers easily in tight spaces. To top it all, it has airless tires that will never go flat.\\nPrice at time of publish: $1,199\\nType: Rear Tine | Tilling Width: 17 inches | Tilling Depth: 11.25 inches | Power Source: Gas-powered | Weight: 160 pounds\\nThe Greenworks 40V 10 inch Cordless Cultivator earns our top spot, because it is lightweight, easy to maneuver, and battery-powered, which means you don’t have to deal with any fumes while gardening. If you’re looking for a heavy-duty tiller for tough jobs, the Earthquake 37037 Pioneer Dual-Direction Rear Tine Tiller is powerful enough to break through hard ground and rocky soil.\\nWhat to Look for in a Tiller\\nTiller Type\\nThe positioning of the tines affects the tool’s tilling capabilities. Front-tine tillers typically have a smaller cultivating depth, which means they don’t go that deep into the soil. A front-tine tiller is ideal for an existing bed that requires minimal tilling and weeding. Rear-tine tillers, on the other hand, can dig deeply into the soil and break up hard ground.\\nSize\\nMechanized tillers offer a higher cutting depth–8 inches or deeper–and can to break up heavy, compacted, or rocky soil. Our top pick for adjustable depth, the Sun Joe TJ602E 12-Inch 8-Amp Electric Garden Tiller/Cultivator, can be extended up to 8 inches to dig deeper into the soil.\\xa0A tiller with a larger tilling width–8 to 12 inches–can cover more ground in one pass, allowing you to get the job done in less time. However, larger tillers are usually heavier and harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\\nElectric tillers have the advantage of being lighter and easier to maneuver, but they can\\'t break up hard ground or turn heavy soil. Most models have a fairly low cutting depth, which means they can only cultivate the first few inches of soil. For that reason, they are best suited for smaller gardens (less than 1,500 square feet) that contain loose soil.\\nPortability\\nThe smaller the tiller, the easier it is to handle. As tillers increase in size, they become bulkier and harder to maneuver in tight areas. Without the hindrance of a cord, a battery-powered model is more versatile. Our best overall pick, the Greenworks 40V 10 inch Cordless Cultivator, can run for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. It is a great option if you’re working outdoors and not close to a power source.\\nPower Source\\nAll of the picks in this roundup are powered by gas, corded electricity, or batteries. Electric tillers are usually less powerful than gas-powered models, making them ideal for smaller gardens with looser soil. Gas-powered tillers are larger, heavier, and a lot more powerful. If you’re cutting a new bed or breaking up compacted soil, a gas-powered tiller is your best bet. Our top choice in this category, the Tazz 35310 2-in-1 Front Tine Tiller/Cultivator, offers superior power for tough terrain.\\nA gas-powered tiller runs on either a two-cycle or four-cycle engine. Two-cycle engines are less expensive and require both oil and gasoline for operation. Four-cycle engines run solely on gas.\\nCorded vs. Cordless\\nSome electric tillers have an electrical cord that must be plugged into an outlet, while others run on batteries.\\nCorded tillers need to be connected to an outlet and an extension cord might come in handy for added mobility. Not only are they a tripping hazard, but cords can also be a nuisance if they tangle up while you’re working.\\nCordless tillers are powered by rechargeable batteries, and they can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours on a single charge. They’re a great option if you’re working outdoors without a power source in proximity. The lack of a cord allows for better maneuverability in tight spaces. However, you will need to monitor the battery level and charge it between uses.\\n“A tiller is a gardening tool that breaks down compact soil into smaller chunks to improve the quality of the soil,” says Kris Kiser, President and CEO of OPEI.\\xa0By digging deeply to turn over compacted soil, a tiller gets your garden in tip-top shape for planting. Kiser also notes that a tiller makes weed removal a lot easier. But Kiser also warns to keep safety in mind before use: \"Once you have selected the best tiller for your gardening needs, like any piece of outdoor power equipment, be certain you have a firm understanding on proper handling and safety procedures by reviewing the owner’s manual,” Kiser notes.\\nCultivators are best suited for existing garden beds because they break up the top few inches of soil without disturbing the plant roots. Cultivators are smaller and less powerful than rototillers and are not intended for breaking up hard ground. However, they do a great job of blending and aerating soil so that it’s ready for planting.\\n“Tillers are generally used for heavy digging and typically reach 8 to 10 inches down into the soil,” notes Kiser. They can be used to prepare new garden beds or dig up old ones. Unlike cultivators, tillers have enough power to break up hard, compacted soil, which enables plant roots to grow downwards without obstructions.\\nSome models give you the best of both worlds, combining a tiller and cultivator in one tool. Our top choice in this category, the Earthquake 12802 MC440 Mini Cultivator, features a convenient, two-in-one design.\\nTillers are usually equipped with two, four, or six tines, though the number varies by model and manufacturer. “The more tines on your tiller, the more power your tiller will have to stir the dirt,” Kiser says.\\nWhy Trust The Spruce?\\nThis article was written by Sage McHugh, a writer for The Spruce who specializes in the home and garden sector. To select the best tillers for this roundup, she considered dozens of products, carefully evaluating their type, size, tilling width and depth, portability, and power source. She also consulted hundreds of customer reviews, as well as write-ups from third-party websites. For expert insight on tillers, McHugh interviewed Kris Kiser, president and CEO of Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI).\\nMore from The Spruce\\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.',\n",

They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate. These machines are small and easy to maneuver, and they can turn a small area of previously worked, loose soil in just a few minutes. \\nIf you have a large garden or heavy clay soil, you’ll need a large rototiller with a powerful engine. These machines–usually rear-time tillers–are bigger and heavier and more powerful, and they are well suited for large spaces.\\nNo matter what size garden or yard you have, be sure to choose a rototiller that is powerful enough to do the job. A weak or underpowered machine will only frustrate you and make the job take longer than it needs to.\\nHere’s our guide to help you buy a rototiller:\\nTable of Contents\\nWhat are rototillers used for?\\nWhat is a rototiller?
