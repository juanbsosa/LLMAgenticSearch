# LLMAgenticSearch
LLM-based application to evaluate web search results, refine search terms, and execute new searches.

(In progress. Coming soon: full repository adapted to a more generic task for everyone to use.)

Created as part of my involvement in the project https://www.machineryofprogress.com/, led by Peter Lambert and Yannick Schindler.
