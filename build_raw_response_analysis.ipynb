They can go just about anywhere and they can tackle big jobs in large spaces. Electric corded and battery-operated rototillers–often called cultivators–are a good choice for small home gardens and lighter, loose soils. They are not as powerful as gas-powered tillers but they are lighter weight, fairly portable, less expensive, and eco-friendly.\\nRototiller manufacturers make tillers in all shapes and sizes, from small, light models to large machines with good-sized motors and big rotating tines. The size of the rototiller you need depends on the size of your garden.\\nIf you have a small home garden, an electric corded rototiller should be adequate.

       "    'raw_content': '\\nSearch the Blog\\nWhat Is a Rotary Tiller and How Is It Used in Gardening?\\nWhether you are replanting your garden from last year, or have decided to put in a new garden, a rotary tiller is ideal to get that seedbed tilled into the perfect texture for planting. Let’s take a look at what a rotary tiller is and what it can be used for.\\nReady to experience the power and precision of John Deere machinery? Contact us today!\\nWhat is a Rotary Tiller?\\nA rotary tiller, which is also known as a rototiller, power tiller, rotavator, rotary hoe, or rotary plow, is a motorized cultivator. It works the soil by means of rotating tines or blades, and is either self-propelled or drawn as an attachment behind either a two-wheel tractor or four-wheel tractor. A rotary tiller is an implement that utilizes its set of curved tines that are attached to a rotating shaft to dig into soil and turn it into a seedbed that’s ready for planting.\\nWhat is a Rotary Tiller Used For?\\nA rotary tiller is a piece of equipment used for both primary and secondary tillage for cultivating soil. Small, self-propelled rotary tillers are typically used for domestic gardens. When they are attached to two-wheel or even four-wheel tractors, rotary tillers are utilized on farms. Additionally, rotary tillers have also been used for cleaning the exterior of oilfield pipes and preparing the ground for road construction. A tractor-mounted rotary tiller is a great tool for breaking down soil in an existing garden or turning a piece of land into a new garden space.\\nPrepping Your Garden\\nRotary tillers are used for primary tillage, as well as secondary tillage, where users break up clods and prepare the soil for planting. Next, they can also be used for cultivation while the crop is growing. If the vegetation is heavy, it is helpful to make a single pass and then wait until after the next rain before tilling again. This process helps to break down your vegetation. Primary tillage requires slow speed, but you may use a higher gear for secondary tillage. It’s important to run your tiller at full engine rpm and then shift gears up or down as necessary.\\nCultivating Your Garden\\nTillers are effective when it comes to cultivating your crops. The cultivation is usually done at a higher ground speed than what you would use for primary or secondary tillage. Using a very shallow depth setting when cultivating will help you avoid damaging crop roots.\\xa0\\nGrowing and Incorporating Organic Matter\\nRotary tillers can help you to incorporate cover crops and green manure crops, which contribute to the health of your garden soil. Additionally, you can improve structure and tilth of your soil by incorporating vegetation and compost. Planting cover crops is also a possibility. Once the seedbed is prepared, you can then broadcast the seed and run the tiller over the soil at high speed and a minimum depth, which will help to cover the seeds. Tillers are the most effective tool for covering larger seeds, such as peas. Small cover crop seeds – like ryegrass – might be covered too deeply with a tiller. Raking or dragging will be more effective for these smaller seeds.\\nMiddlebusting\\nWide sweeps, also known as middlebusters, are the most useful accessory for your tiller. A middlebuster attaches to the rear of the tiller, allowing you to dig a more shallow furrow. Two passes with a middlebuster throws up a raised bed, which can be important in certain areas. Then, you can level the top of that raised bed to plant your crops.\\xa0\\nTrenching\\nTillers also have uses outside of gardens. One example of another use is digging ditches or trenches. Start by running the tiller over the ditch line to loosen the soil. Once this first step is complete, you will want to shovel out the loosened soil and repeat until you reach your desired depth.\\nConsiderations for Using a Rotary Tiller\\nNow that we understand what a rotary tiller is, let’s take a look at some of the things to learn and remember when it comes to gardening with one.\\nAttachments\\nDifferent kinds of tillers can be fitted with attachments to do jobs other than gardening. Some small, hand-held tiller models can utilize dethatching tines or rotary brushes. Some larger rear-tine tillers can handle snow/dirt blades or middle busters. You can also have the entire tiller assembly replaced with sicklebar mowers, shredders/grinders, or even generators. \\nAdjusting the Working Depth\\nThe working depth of a rotary tiller can be increased or decreased by adjusting the skid shoes. Typically, larger tillers come with a deeper maximum cutting depth. When working with a rotary tiller in a large vegetable garden, operators should try to not cut much deeper than 6 inches down.\\nConsidering Working Width\\nWhen looking to purchase a rotary tiller, operators should always keep the width of their tractor’s rear tires in mind. The tiller should be at least as wide as the rear tractor tire base, otherwise, some parts of the garden may go un-tilled. When tilling the garden, operators should be sure to overlap with each pass.\\nUsing a Rotary Tiller in a New Garden\\nWhen creating a new garden, operators should first plow the soil in the fall and let it sit through the winter. Then, in the spring, a rotary tiller should be used to go through the soil multiple times, or until the soil is turned about 4 to 6 inches deep and there are no large soil clods left behind. It’s important for operators to start slowly and not go too deep – tilling too fast will likely leave un-tilled portions of soil behind.\\nAdjusting the Tailgate\\nThe tailgate on rotary tillers can be adjusted to match the soil type the operator wishes to leave behind. A more open tailgate allows larger clods to come out and will leave behind a coarse soil.\\nRotary Tiller Frequently Asked Questions\\nWhat is the Difference Between a Rotary Tiller and a Hoe?\\nA rotary tiller and a hoe are both gardening tools used to break up and loosen soil, but their differences lie in the type of environment they are used in. For example, a rotary tiller is a power tool that uses rotating blades to break up soil and is most commonly used on larger landscapes to prepare seed beds for planting.

If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\\nLearn more.\\nThe 13 Best Tillers of 2023\\nThe Greenworks 40V 10 inch Cordless Cultivator is our top pick\\nThe Spruce / Kevin Liang\\nA tiller reduces the time and effort it takes to prepare your soil for planting, especially if the soil is compacted or rocky. When selecting a tiller, keep in mind the size of your garden. “A front-tine tiller is smaller, lighter, and easy to maneuver. Most people find them convenient to use and they are ideal for small to medium-sized gardens, and gardens with tight corners,” notes Kris Kiser, president, and CEO of Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI).\\nFrom compact, electric models to heavy-duty, gas-powered tillers, you\\'ll find plenty of options available to suit your specific needs. When researching the best tillers, we evaluated products based on their type, size, tilling width and depth, portability, and power source.\\nBest Overall\\nGreenworks 40V 10-Inch Cordless Tiller and Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nRuns up to 40 minutes on a single charge\\nQuick charging time\\nAdjustable tilling width\\nEasy push-button start\\nSome reports of missing parts or pieces\\nThis cordless electric tiller from Greenworks is our best overall pick, because it is simple to use, is quick to charge, has an adjustable width, and is easy to maintain. It is equipped with a 40-volt battery, which allows it to run for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. The runtime can be extended even longer if you have additional batteries. It only takes two hours for the batteries to completely charge. The four front tines can till as deep as five inches, and the tilling width is adjustable between 8.25 inches and 10 inches.\\nThanks to a push-button start, it’s a cinch to get this front-tine tiller going. For added safety, it has a cut-off switch to prevent accidental startups. At 21 pounds, the Greenworks cordless electric cultivator is fairly lightweight, and the two rear wheels support a good portion of its weight.\\nRequiring no gas or oil, this battery-powered unit is practically maintenance-free. It’s also quieter, and it has a lot less vibration than gas-powered models. We read some reports of missing parts, so be sure to inspect your tiller thoroughly upon arrival. The manufacturer offers three year-warranties on both the tool and batteries.\\nPrice at time of publish: $270\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 8.25 to 10 inches | Tilling Depth: 5 inches | Power Source: Cordless electric | Weight: 21 pounds\\nBest Budget\\nEarthwise TC70001 11-Inch 8.5-Amp Electric Tiller\\nAmazon\\nTiller and cultivator all-in-one\\nLightweight and easy to maneuver\\nSoft, ergonomic handle\\nOnly one speed\\nA few reports of breakdowns\\nThis corded electric tiller from Earthwise is an affordably priced option that’s ideal for small to medium-sized gardens. The four front tines can till up to 11 inches wide and 8 inches deep. Powered by an 8.5-amp motor, this rototiller will run as long as you need it to once it’s plugged into an outlet. The single-lever switch is easy to operate, ensuring that the engine starts right up every time.\\nAt just 27 pounds, this unit is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It also has an ergonomic, V-shaped handle that provides a comfortable grip and better maneuverability. Another convenient feature is a cord-retention hook for uninterrupted tilling power. Best of all, the Earthwise electric tiller delivers a powerful performance without gas or fumes.\\nNote that this unit can only be operated at one speed. Although it’s powerful, you can’t increase the pace when the conditions call for it. We have read a small number of reports that say the tiller stopped working very quickly. Be sure to take advantage of the two-year warranty if you encounter any problems or defects.\\nPrice at time of publish: $140\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 11 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Corded electric | Weight: 27 pounds\\nBest Compact\\nMantis 4-Cycle Tiller Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nSleek, space-saving design\\nLightweight and easy to carry\\nErgonomic, foldable handle\\nAdjustable tilling depth\\nRequires regular refills\\nSome reports of broken parts\\nThis mini tiller from Mantis has a slim profile that will take up minimal space in a garage or shed. At just 24 pounds, this tool is extremely lightweight and easy to transport. It features ergonomically flared handles for comfortable operation. The handles fold down for easy carrying and storage. It has powerful, four-blade steel tines and the tilling depth is adjustable from 3 to 10 inches. With a 9–inch tilling width, this compact machine can get into tight spots that a larger tiller can’t reach.\\nThe Mantis Tiller Cultivator has a four-cycle engine and requires both gas and oil for operation. Like any model in this category, you will need to keep an eye on the fluid levels. It has a recoil start, which is a bit trickier to operate than a push-button start. We have read some reports of the tiller breaking or bending after several uses. The good news is that this product is backed by a two-year warranty to protect your investment.\\nPrice at time of publish: $399\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 9 inches | Tilling Depth: 10 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 24 pounds\\nBest Cultivator\\nGardenTrax Mini Tiller Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nWeeds, mixes, and aerates all at once\\nAdjustable tilling width\\nPowerful engine for deep tilling\\nNot suitable for hard ground\\nEngine may take a while to start\\nThe Garden Trax cultivator is a versatile machine that’s able to weed, mix, and aerate soil at the same time. Its tilling width can be adjusted from 6 to 12 inches, allowing you to work in areas of various sizes. The gas-powered, two-cycle engine delivers enough power for deep tilling (up to 6 inches). Just keep in mind that this front-tine cultivator isn’t intended to break up hard ground. It does a great job of prepping the soil before planting, however.\\nAt 33 pounds, the Garden Trax is one of the heaviest tillers in our roundup. Luckily, the two adjustable wheels absorb most of the weight and make it easy to maneuver. Note that this tiller is equipped with a manual recoil, rather than a push-button start, which may take longer to get going.\\nPrice at time of publish: $200\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 6 to 12 inches | Tilling Depth: 6 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 33 pounds\\nBest for Large Gardens\\nChampion Power Equipment 100379 22 in. Front Tine Tiller\\nCompact design with stored wheels\\nIdeal for larger gardens\\nAdjustable tilling width and depth\\nRequires regular refills\\nSome reports of broken parts\\nWith an adjustable tilling depth of up to 8 inches, the Champion 100379 is ideal for preparing large flower beds and vegetable gardens. The tilling width is adjustable between 16 to 22 inches, allowing you to weed between wide rows. This versatile electric tiller has a slim profile and flip-down wheels, so it’s easy to store when not in use. The compact design and stored wheels make it easy to transport across driveways and sidewalks. A 212cc engine powers four heavy-duty steel tines with dual rotation, which can break up hard ground and turn it into viable soil.\\nNote that this tiller uses gasoline and oil, which will require regular refills. You’ll have to keep an eye on the levels, but it is equipped with a low-oil shut-off sensor. We have read some reports that the tiller stopped working in a short period of time. To ensure customer satisfaction, Champion backs this product with a two-year limited warranty and free lifetime technical support.\\nPrice at time of publish: $799\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 22 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 119.1 pounds\\nBest for Small Gardens\\nBlack+Decker 20V Max Cordless Garden Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nIdeal for small gardens\\nCordless convenience\\nLightweight and easy to maneuver\\nErgonomic, telescoping handle\\nLess powerful than other options\\nBattery takes a while to recharge\\nFor existing gardens that only require a minimal amount of cultivating, the BLACK+DECKER 20V MAX Tiller is a great choice. This affordably priced tiller/cultivator is ideal for smaller areas, and it can till up to 325 square feet on a single charge. Powered by a 20-volt lithium-ion battery, this cordless model is convenient and portable. Counter-oscillating tines quickly eliminate weeds and prevent them from tangling. The soft-grip, telescoping handle makes it comfortable to hold for longer periods of time.\\nAt just over 8 pounds, this BLACK+DECKER tiller is lightweight and easy to maneuver.\\xa0 We have read some complaints that the battery life is a bit shorter than expected and that it can take up to eight hours to fully recharge. Also note that with a maximum cultivating depth of four inches, this tool is limited for use on softer garden soil and shallower weeds, but we think for smaller gardens with the right soil, this budget-friendly tiller is a great choice.\\nPrice at time of publish: $87\\nType: Not listed | Tilling Width: 7 inches | Tilling Depth: 4 inches | Power Source: Cordless electric | Weight: 8.1 pounds\\nBest Combo\\nEarthquake 12802 MC440 Mini Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nAdjustable tines for multiple tasks\\nVariable speeds\\nEasy to maneuver\\nOptional edger and dethatcher kit (sold separately)\\nCan be tricky to start\\nThis tiller/cultivator combo can be used with an optional edging or dethatching kit, making it a great multipurpose option. Its four-cycle, gas-powered engine delivers plenty of power, allowing you to work through all types of pre-tilled earth. The four front tines can till up to 8 inches deep and 10 inches wide, and since they’re adjustable, you can easily switch between tilling and cultivating modes. This unit offers variable speed controls too, so you can increase the power to tackle tough terrain.\\nDespite all its power, the Earthquake Mini Cultivator is relatively lightweight at 32 pounds and easy to maneuver. This unit features an air filter that helps to keep damaging debris out of the engine. However, we have read some complaints that the pull-cord start can be tricky to operate. It comes with a five-year warranty to ensure years of reliable use, though some customers report difficulties with customer service.\\nPrice at time of publish: $269\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 10 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Cordless gas | Weight: 32 pounds\\nBest Adjustable Depth\\nSun Joe TJ602E 12-Inch 8-Amp Electric Garden Tiller/Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nAdjustable digging depth\\nFast 300 rpm speed\\nThree-position wheel adjustment\\nFoldable handle for convenient storage\\nOnly one speed\\nCord limits portability\\nThis electric rototiller from Sun Joe allows you to adjust the digging depth up to 8 inches, which helps to break up rocky or compacted soil. It has four steel angled tines and a powerful 8-amp motor that cultivates up to 12 inches wide. Other convenient features include three-position, height-adjustable rear wheels and dual handles for easy maneuvering. When not in use, the frame collapses for compact storage in a garage or shed.\\nNote that this rototiller is corded, which means it’s less portable than other models. It only operates in one speed mode, but at 300 rpm, it can slice through heavy soil quickly and easily. We read some reports of the motor and blades breaking within a short period of time. The good news is that this product is backed by a two-year warranty, and the manufacturer will send a replacement with no questions asked.\\nPrice at time of publish: $116\\nType: Rear Tine | Tilling Width: 12 inches | Tilling Depth: 8 inches | Power Source: Electric | Weight: 23.15 pounds\\nBest Gas\\nTazz 35310 2-in-1 Front Tine Tiller/Cultivator\\nAmazon\\nVery powerful\\nConvenient\\nTwo-in-one design\\nAdjustable tilling width and depth\\nHandle adjusts to four different heights\\nRequires regular refills\\nSome reports of broken parts\\nWith a powerful yet fuel efficient 79cc Viper engine, this gas-powered model is designed for heavy-duty jobs. The tilling depth is adjustable up to 11 inches, and the forged steel tines can easily break up dense soil. By removing the outer tines and side shields, this unit quickly transforms from a tiller into a cultivator. The tilling width is also adjustable between 21 and 11 inches, giving you more coverage as your garden grows. At a whopping 85.8 pounds, this machine may sound extremely heavy, but it’s easy to maneuver, thanks to a low center of gravity and excellent stability.\\nThe steel handlebar has four height positions, so users can comfortably steer it without having to bend over. Keep in mind that this powerful tool consumes a good amount of gas and oil. You’ll need to monitor the levels on a regular basis. The Tazz 35310 is one of the most expensive options on our list, but it also offers superior power and a convenient, two-in-one design. We have read some reports of pieces breaking in a short period of time. However, this product is backed by a three-year warranty to protect your investment.\\nPrice at time of publish: $325\\nType: Front Tine | Tilling Width: 21 inches | Tilling Depth: 11 inches | Power Source: Gas | Weight: 85.8 pounds\\nBest Heavy-Duty\\nEarthquake 37037 Pioneer Dual-Direction Rear Tine Tiller\\nAmazon\\nExtremely powerful\\nDual-direction tines\\nEasy to shift\\nInstant reverse\\nVery expensive\\nBulkier than other options\\nThe Earthquake Pioneer Dual-Direction Rear Tine Tiller can handle your toughest tilling jobs. Equipped with a 99cc 4-cycle Viper engine, it can break through hard ground and heavily compacted soil with ease. The dual-direction design allows you to operate in two modes: Counter-rotating tines can bust sod and till hard soil, while standard-rotating tines are ideal for mixing tilled soil. Plus, it can till up to 11.25 inches deep and 17 inches wide. This gas-powered tiller is easy to shift and goes into reverse almost immediately with the pull of a handle.\\nIt’s no big surprise that all this power and convenience comes at a steep cost. The Earthquake Pioneer is the most expensive option in our roundup, but its strength is unparalleled At 160 pounds, it’s also the heaviest tiller on our list. Thanks to dual control handlebars and a low center of gravity, however, this machine rides smoothly and maneuvers easily in tight spaces. To top it all, it has airless tires that will never go flat.\\nPrice at time of publish: $1,199\\nType: Rear Tine | Tilling Width: 17 inches | Tilling Depth: 11.25 inches | Power Source: Gas-powered | Weight: 160 pounds\\nThe Greenworks 40V 10 inch Cordless Cultivator earns our top spot, because it is lightweight, easy to maneuver, and battery-powered, which means you don’t have to deal with any fumes while gardening. If you’re looking for a heavy-duty tiller for tough jobs, the Earthquake 37037 Pioneer Dual-Direction Rear Tine Tiller is powerful enough to break through hard ground and rocky soil.\\nWhat to Look for in a Tiller\\nTiller Type\\nThe positioning of the tines affects the tool’s tilling capabilities. Front-tine tillers typically have a smaller cultivating depth, which means they don’t go that deep into the soil. A front-tine tiller is ideal for an existing bed that requires minimal tilling and weeding. Rear-tine tillers, on the other hand, can dig deeply into the soil and break up hard ground.\\nSize\\nMechanized tillers offer a higher cutting depth–8 inches or deeper–and can to break up heavy, compacted, or rocky soil. Our top pick for adjustable depth, the Sun Joe TJ602E 12-Inch 8-Amp Electric Garden Tiller/Cultivator, can be extended up to 8 inches to dig deeper into the soil.\\xa0A tiller with a larger tilling width–8 to 12 inches–can cover more ground in one pass, allowing you to get the job done in less time. However, larger tillers are usually heavier and harder to maneuver in tight spaces.\\nElectric tillers have the advantage of being lighter and easier to maneuver, but they can\\'t break up hard ground or turn heavy soil. Most models have a fairly low cutting depth, which means they can only cultivate the first few inches of soil. For that reason, they are best suited for smaller gardens (less than 1,500 square feet) that contain loose soil.\\nPortability\\nThe smaller the tiller, the easier it is to handle. As tillers increase in size, they become bulkier and harder to maneuver in tight areas. Without the hindrance of a cord, a battery-powered model is more versatile. Our best overall pick, the Greenworks 40V 10 inch Cordless Cultivator, can run for up to 40 minutes on a single charge. It is a great option if you’re working outdoors and not close to a power source.\\nPower Source\\nAll of the picks in this roundup are powered by gas, corded electricity, or batteries. Electric tillers are usually less powerful than gas-powered models, making them ideal for smaller gardens with looser soil. Gas-powered tillers are larger, heavier, and a lot more powerful. If you’re cutting a new bed or breaking up compacted soil, a gas-powered tiller is your best bet. Our top choice in this category, the Tazz 35310 2-in-1 Front Tine Tiller/Cultivator, offers superior power for tough terrain.\\nA gas-powered tiller runs on either a two-cycle or four-cycle engine. Two-cycle engines are less expensive and require both oil and gasoline for operation. Four-cycle engines run solely on gas.\\nCorded vs. Cordless\\nSome electric tillers have an electrical cord that must be plugged into an outlet, while others run on batteries.\\nCorded tillers need to be connected to an outlet and an extension cord might come in handy for added mobility. Not only are they a tripping hazard, but cords can also be a nuisance if they tangle up while you’re working.\\nCordless tillers are powered by rechargeable batteries, and they can run anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours on a single charge. They’re a great option if you’re working outdoors without a power source in proximity. The lack of a cord allows for better maneuverability in tight spaces. However, you will need to monitor the battery level and charge it between uses.\\n“A tiller is a gardening tool that breaks down compact soil into smaller chunks to improve the quality of the soil,” says Kris Kiser, President and CEO of OPEI.\\xa0By digging deeply to turn over compacted soil, a tiller gets your garden in tip-top shape for planting. Kiser also notes that a tiller makes weed removal a lot easier. But Kiser also warns to keep safety in mind before use: \"Once you have selected the best tiller for your gardening needs, like any piece of outdoor power equipment, be certain you have a firm understanding on proper handling and safety procedures by reviewing the owner’s manual,” Kiser notes.\\nCultivators are best suited for existing garden beds because they break up the top few inches of soil without disturbing the plant roots. Cultivators are smaller and less powerful than rototillers and are not intended for breaking up hard ground. However, they do a great job of blending and aerating soil so that it’s ready for planting.\\n“Tillers are generally used for heavy digging and typically reach 8 to 10 inches down into the soil,” notes Kiser. They can be used to prepare new garden beds or dig up old ones. Unlike cultivators, tillers have enough power to break up hard, compacted soil, which enables plant roots to grow downwards without obstructions.\\nSome models give you the best of both worlds, combining a tiller and cultivator in one tool. Our top choice in this category, the Earthquake 12802 MC440 Mini Cultivator, features a convenient, two-in-one design.\\nTillers are usually equipped with two, four, or six tines, though the number varies by model and manufacturer. “The more tines on your tiller, the more power your tiller will have to stir the dirt,” Kiser says.\\nWhy Trust The Spruce?\\nThis article was written by Sage McHugh, a writer for The Spruce who specializes in the home and garden sector. To select the best tillers for this roundup, she considered dozens of products, carefully evaluating their type, size, tilling width and depth, portability, and power source. She also consulted hundreds of customer reviews, as well as write-ups from third-party websites. For expert insight on tillers, McHugh interviewed Kris Kiser, president and CEO of Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI).\\nMore from The Spruce\\nBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.',\n",

For the price of the tiller, include a real user manual.... I bought this roto-tiller from ASC the other day. This roto-tiller works amazingly. the only thing I would recommend is getting ASC to print a manual because it does not come with one and there is no link for one.

       "    'raw_content': '48\" Rotary Tiller, Gear Driven\\nWith a working width of 48 inches, this 3-point rotary tiller has 6 flanges with 6 tiller blades each. The recommended tractor horsepower for this tiller is 20 to 35 hp. \\nSpecifications:\\nWe also carry a variety of other tillovator sizes, as well as King Kutter and Caroni brands.\\nShipping & Return\\n\\rWorks great with my John Deere 755. Best overall price and reviews I could find for a tiller.  — Stephen Eason from NC \\nWorks great with my John Deere 755. Best overall price and reviews I could find for a tiller. \\nGear driven, quality of construction, price were good compared to other manufacturers. Setting up was a pain as there is only an online manual. Did not get one when I bought it. The online manual is fine except, the pictures are crap....trying to find the right plug or area discussed is a pain. For the price of the tiller, include a real user manual....\\nI bought this roto-tiller from ASC the other day. I have used it a twice so far and it has tilled the garden and two food plots with no problem. I have a little 1220 compact ford with a 17 HP motor and it eats on thru the ground. This roto-tiller works amazingly. I would highly recommend this purchase. the only thing I would recommend is getting ASC to print a manual because it does not come with one and there is no link for one.\\nOnly about 2 days of ownership and a little over 200 ft of tilling, but so far so good.  Bonus - i-Match compatible behind my JD 1025R\\nRead the reviews and was still skeptical, but I can\\'t be happier with this purchase. It Shipped right to my door, checked oil and grease and then I was off. This thing cut through GA clay like you wouldn\\'t believe. Tilled about an acre of a field covered with short cut grass. Tore through this old field with ease. Now all that\\'s left is fresh tilled ground, a new field of Black Raspberries and the other usual garden favorites. Highly recommended for the quality and price. \\nKeep up on our always evolving product features, events, content and so much more.

Don’t just focus on the sticker price. Other costs can really add up. Let’s break them down.\\nMaintenance and Repairs\\nA well-maintained excavator lasts longer and performs better.\\nCosts vary.\\nBigger machines and those used more often cost more to maintain. Older ones too. Expect to spend between $6,000 and $18,000 a year. This covers inspections, parts, and surprise repairs.\\nInsurance\\nProtect your investment!\\nInsurance costs depend on the excavator’s value, where you use it, and how you use it. Basic liability insurance starts around $1,000 a year. This gets you $1 million in coverage.\\nWant more protection?\\nComprehensive coverage is pricier but covers theft and damage.\\nFuel and Operating Costs\\nFuel is a major expense. Big excavators gulp 5-10 gallons of diesel per hour. Smaller ones use 2-4 gallons. Fuel prices change constantly, so this adds up fast.\\nGood news! Newer models are often more fuel-efficient.\\nEnvironmental Compliance\\nEnvironmental rules are getting stricter. Meeting these standards costs money. Think $2,000 to $5,000 a year. This varies by location and the age of your machine.\\nCost Summary\\n| Cost Category | Estimated Annual Cost (2024) |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Maintenance | $6,000 – $18,000 |\\n| Insurance | $1,000 – $3,500 |\\n| Fuel (based on 1000 hours/year) | $12,000 – $35,000 |\\n| Environmental Compliance | $2,000 – $5,000 |\\n| Other Operating Expenses | $22,000 – $55,000 |\\nKnowing these extra costs gives you the full picture. This helps you make smarter choices. And avoid money surprises down the road.\\nWant to learn more about managing these costs? Let’s talk about financing options next. They can make owning an excavator easier.\\nFinancing Options for Excavator Purchases\\n\\nNeed an excavator but not sure how to pay for it (or, the best way to pay for it)? You’ve got options! Let’s explore them.\\nLoans\\nLoans are common for excavators. They usually last 24 to 72 months. The loan length depends on the excavator’s age and condition. Your credit score matters too. Some lenders work with scores as low as 550. But a higher score gets you better terms.\\nWorried about credit checks?\\nSome lenders do “soft” checks. These don’t hurt your score. This is great if your credit history isn’t perfect.\\nWant an idea of monthly payments? Here’s a quick look, assuming you have good credit:\\n| Loan Term | Monthly Payment Range |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| 24 months | $1,250 – $1,350 |\\n| 36 months | $850 – $975 |\\n| 48 months | $650 – $775 |\\n| 60 months | $525 – $625 |\\nLeasing\\nLeasing is another option. Lease payments are often lower than loan payments. Why? Because you don’t own the excavator at the end. Several things affect your monthly payment: lease length, excavator cost, your credit score, and your business history.\\nConsiderations\\nSo, loan or lease?\\nThink about your needs and finances. Loans and leases are good for long-term use. Renting makes more sense for short-term projects.\\nNew excavators are expensive! They can cost $200,000 to over $1,500,000. Choosing the right financing is key. Compare offers from different lenders. Look at interest rates, terms, and fees.\\nWant to save even more? Let’s talk about ways to reduce your overall excavator costs. This helps you get the most out of your investment, no matter how you finance it.\\nTips for Reducing Excavator Costs\\n\\nImplementing smart strategies can lead to significant savings on excavator costs.

Prices can vary based on factors like new or used condition and region.\\nWhy is an excavator so expensive?\\nExcavators are expensive due to their complex engineering, high-quality materials, and the advanced hydraulics and technology needed for heavy-duty tasks. Additionally, their durability, power, and ability to handle large workloads contribute to the high cost.\\nIs 5000 hours a lot for an excavator?\\nYes, 5,000 hours is significant but not excessive for an excavator. With proper maintenance, most excavators can last between 6,000 and 10,000 hours or more, though performance may decline after 5,000 hours.\\nHow much does an excavator dig cost?\\nExcavation costs using an excavator range from $100 to $250 per hour, depending on the machine size, project complexity, and location. Total project costs depend on factors like soil type and depth of the dig.\\n\\nRhett C\\nRhett is a certified heavy equipment appraiser and the founder of HeavyEquipmentAppraisal.com, a leading global provider of equipment valuation services.\\n\\nPost navigation\\n👈 Previous 7 Excavator Bucket Teeth Types for Boosting Productivity & ROI\\n© 2024 Heavy Equipment Appraisal\\nPrivacy Policy | Terms\\n\\n🏠︎Start Appraisal\\n\\nAboutToggle child menu\\n\\nAbout Heavy Equipment Appraisal\\nQualifications\\nFAQ\\n\\nServicesToggle child menu\\n\\n\\nAppraisalsToggle child menu\\n\\nIntro to Heavy Equipment Values\\nCoverage Area\\nNationwide Equipment Appraisal\\nOnline Equipment Appraisal\\nOn-Site Equipment Appraisal\\nUsed Tractor Appraisal\\n\\nFarm Equipment Appraisal\\n\\nEquipment FinancingToggle child menu\\n\\n\\n\\nFarm Equipment Financing\\n\\nTractor Financing\\n\\nTruck FinancingToggle child menu\\n\\nDump Truck Financing\\nSemi Truck Financing\\nEquipment TypesToggle child menu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcavators\\n\\nForklifts\\nSkid Steers\\nTractors\\nBlog\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch for:\",\n",
